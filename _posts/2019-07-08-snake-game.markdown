    This is a snake agent based simulation, trying to avoid the dangers of colliding into itself or the walls while trying to get the highest possible score from eating apples.<br><br>

    Attaking machine learning and reinforcement learning like never before, I decided to take on a broad and challenging project into my own hands.<br><br>

    I decided that I wanted to try to start small and build from there, so I came up with the simplest scenario possible - a snake game. I this classic archade game play all by itself and make the highest score possible. To do this I needed an agent to act as the snake and make the action decisions, depending on the perception.<br><br>

    In classical AI, one of the first things we learn is the agentsâ€™ preceptors and actuators. The preceptors are the agentsâ€™ vision and sensory system, to let it perceive and collect data from the outside world and bring it internally to possibly process, memorise and train for later.<br><br>

    The actuators on the other hand are things like its limbs or wheels, motors, speakers and other means of affecting the environment. Over time, the agent will often build a set of if-then rules from its collected data, so that it knows for instance where it is, how the environment seem to behave and what to do in the future - normally to achieve a specific task. The task is normally to change the environmentâ€™s state - the end goal. So for instance to hover all dust particles, remove all space junk or sort recycled waste.<br><br>
