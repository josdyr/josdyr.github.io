    <!-- Qualification -->
    <p>
      I've recently graduated with a Batchelor of Science in Computer Science with Honours from Edinburgh Napier University. My dissertation looked at Machine Learning, more specifically deep learning and reinforcement learning. It concluded that using neural networks were quicker than the more traditional Q Learning Algorithm.
