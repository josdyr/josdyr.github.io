      I'm a recent graduate of a BSc (Hons) Computing Science at Edinburgh Napier University. My dissertation I looked at observing agents, optimize them and analyse the rewards, learning rate and fitness of the agents given different parameters playing a classic snake arcade game.

      My passion is for Data Science and Machine Learning. I wish to connect and work with wonderful people, like you! Thanks for visiting my website, and feel free to get in touch with me! ‚òéÔ∏è
